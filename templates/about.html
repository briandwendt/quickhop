                About QuickHop
            </h4>

                Some Background
            </h5>

            <p class="light">QuickHop was built primarily for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_staff_travel" target="_blank">non-revenue travelers</a>
            and passriders, to provide a quick and easy means of locating available flight
            options between city pairs.</p>

            <p class="light">Other web-based travel tools may provide more detail and more search
            features, but QuickHop is designed to be used on your mobile phone, with one
            hand, while running through a crowded terminal.</p>

                Who We Are
            </h5>

            <p class="light">There's no "we" really. QuickHop was built by Brian Wendt, a former
            airline and corporate pilot turned engineering student.</p>

            <p class="light">QuickHop isn't a business, it's just a small project that hopefully helps to
            smooth out those nail-biting commutes and multi-leg non-rev "vacations." If
            you're nodding and smiling right now, you've been there.</p>

            <p class="light">QuickHop doesn't exist to make money, but it does cost money to operate. If
            you feel this site makes your travels a bit easier, please consider donating
            whatever you can. It's much appreciated. There's a "Donate" button at the bottom
            of the page.</p>

                Under the Hood
            </h5>

            <p class="light">QuickHop is written in Python, using the Flask web framework, and runs on
            Google's App Engine. The flight data is sourced from the FlightStats API. The
            code is open source and is available
            <a href="https://github.com/briandwendt/quickhop" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
